# Fair-Rations-algo
The code simulates the process of making all bread counts even by iterating through the array and performing operations on adjacent odd-parity elements, counting each flip to track the total loaves distributed. If the last element remains odd after processing, it's impossible, so it returns "NO"; otherwise, it returns the total loaves twice the operation count as a string.
